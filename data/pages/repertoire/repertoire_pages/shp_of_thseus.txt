SHP of THSEUS is a collaborative audiovisual composition that draws inspiration from the Greek legend of the Ship of Theseus. As with the ship in the original story, various components and settings of our instruments are altered throughout the duration of the performance, changing sonic characteristics and the roles of the individual performers. We navigate this question of identity through a graphical score and custom instruments that expose parameters to the entire ensemble through the use of a shared network control structure.

SHP of THSEUS uses the Collab-Hub network performance utility for performers to share control data with each other in realtime.
This composition can optionally be performed as a telematic work if the necessary audio/video sharing utilities are incorporated.
