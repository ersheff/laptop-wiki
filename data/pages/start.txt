Welcome to the **Laptop Ensemble Media and Repertoire Reference** (name pending).
The purpose of this community-sourced wiki is to facilitate organizing, planning, and concert programming
for technology-based ensembles. This can include laptop ensembles or orchestras, mobile device ensembles,
ensembles of sensor-based instruments, etc.

Currently, this wiki is concentrated on 3 primary sections:
  * Repertoire: Composers/programmers/designers/artists can create pages to share their pieces and ensemble directors can find music for their groups to learn and perform.
  * [[software|Software Share]]: A place for programmers/designers to share their non-commercial utilities and instruments.
  * [[handbook|Handbook]]: A collection of articles, how-to guides, recommendations, and other practical advice.

Over time, these sections can be expanded, modified, and/or replaced.
New sections can always be created to suit the growing needs of the community.
