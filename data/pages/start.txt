Welcome to the **Laptop Ensemble Media and Repertoire Reference** (working title).
The purpose of this community-sourced wiki is to facilitate organizing, planning, and concert programming
for technology-based ensembles. This can include laptop ensembles or orchestras, mobile device ensembles,
ensembles of sensor-based instruments, etc.

Currently, this wiki is concentrated on 3 primary sections:
  * Repertoire
    * [[repertoire:repertoire_search|Search]]: Ensemble directors can find music for their groups to learn and perform.
    * [[repertoire:repertoire_submit|Submit]]: Composers/programmers/designers/artists can create pages to share their work.
  * [[wiki:software_share|Software Share]]: A page for programmers/designers to share their non-commercial utilities and instruments.
  * [[wiki:handbook|Handbook]]: A collection of articles, how-to guides, recommendations, and other practical advice.

Over time, these sections can be expanded, modified, and/or replaced.
New sections can be created to suit the growing needs of the community.
