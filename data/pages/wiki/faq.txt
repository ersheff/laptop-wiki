**Why a wiki? Why not just a shared Google Drive folder?**

Structure, consistency, flexibility, and community ownership.


**Why DokuWiki? Why not something prettier like a Fandom site?**

DokuWiki is open-source, saves pages as plain text files (no database required, easy to archive),
has been around for a long time, and has an extensive collection of plugins to extend functionality.
The tagging system is a little clunky (hopefully this will be addressed by a plugin update),
but as you'll hopefully see on the [[:repertoire|Repertoire]] page, it makes it much easier to find music
that fits the needs of your specific group.
