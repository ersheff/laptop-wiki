<strong>Why a wiki? Why not just a shared Google Drive folder?</strong>
</p>

<p>
Structure, consistency, flexibility, and community ownership.

<p>
<strong>Why DokuWiki? Why not something prettier like a Fandom site?</strong>
</p>

<p>
DokuWiki is open-source, saves pages as plain text files (no database required, easy to archive),
has been around for a long time, and has an extensive collection of plugins to extend functionality.
The tagging system is a little clunky (hopefully this will be addressed by a plugin update),
but as you&#039;ll hopefully see on the <a href="/doku.php?id=repertoire" class="wikilink1" title="repertoire" data-wiki-id="repertoire">Repertoire</a> page, it makes it much easier to find music
that fits the needs of your specific group.
