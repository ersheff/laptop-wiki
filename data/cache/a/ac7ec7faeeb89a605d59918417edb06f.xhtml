Welcome to the <strong>Laptop Ensemble Media and Repertoire Reference</strong> (name pending).
The purpose of this community-sourced wiki is to facilitate organizing, planning, and concert programming
for technology-based ensembles. This can include laptop ensembles or orchestras, mobile device ensembles,
ensembles of sensor-based instruments, etc.
</p>

<p>
Currently, this wiki is concentrated on 3 primary sections:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Repertoire: Composers/programmers/designers/artists can create pages to share their pieces and ensemble directors can find music for their groups to learn and perform.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="/doku.php?id=software" class="wikilink1" title="software" data-wiki-id="software">Software Share</a>: A place for programmers/designers to share their non-commercial utilities and instruments.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="/doku.php?id=handbook" class="wikilink1" title="handbook" data-wiki-id="handbook">Handbook</a>: A collection of articles, how-to guides, recommendations, and other practical advice.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Over time, these sections can be expanded, modified, and/or replaced.
New sections can always be created to suit the growing needs of the community.
